ZephyrPay Coverage Badge Generator

This script analyzes a coverage XML report and generates a badge-compatible 
output that can be used in GitHub Actions to generate coverage badges.

Following ZephyrPay standards v1.1 which requires:
- 90% minimum overall coverage
- 95% minimum for security-critical components

Usage:
    python generate_coverage_badge.py [coverage_xml_path]
